Description:
   This script detects flash .flv movies and
   adds download links at the bottom of that movie,
   it currently supports youtube videos with multiple
   download formats, and generic .flv movies.

   tested on:
   - flv-player videos (http://flv-player.net/) and opensource
   - flv player (http://www.trenttompkins.com/Downloads/OpenSource-FLV-Player.html)
   - dailymotion.com
   - trilulilu.ro
   - shiftdelete.net
   - wimp.com
   - and of course, youtube.com

   Known Issues:
   - Sometimes you have to download the video via 
     right click > Save linked content as ... (I am not sure why this is necesary,
     probably opera is trying to handle the mime tipe?)
   - Sometimes it crash some versions of Opera 10.52 (at least on Linux)

About the development:
  I proposed myself 3 objectives to develop this userJS:
    1- Speed on runtime
    2- Minimal interference on the host webpage
    3- Scalability

  The first objective was targeted by using the UserJS's efficient code
  guidelines, specially on fast loops
  The 2nd objective was achieved by combining the use of appropriate tags
  and then apply as few styling as possible.
  The application is ready to add more page specific code without having
  to modify the rest of the code, that way I was able to accomplish the
  3rd objective.


Future development:
  I will add more players depending on the demand and difficulty.
  I want to add online transcoding services to allow download
  Add a little style
  Add an embeed non-flash player, I'm working on the firsts steps
